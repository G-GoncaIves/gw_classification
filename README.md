# Code for Paper: [Machine-Learning Love: classifying the equation of state of neutron stars with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08382)

This repository contains the code used for the paper [Machine-Learning Love: classifying the equation of state of neutron stars with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08382). 

## Overview

This code is built upon the **Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)** model, as introduced and implemented by Yuan Gong and collaborators. You can find the original AST implementation [here](https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast). We extend, modify, and customize the AST model to meet the specific requirements of our research.
